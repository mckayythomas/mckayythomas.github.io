            <h2>Preston Idaho History</h2>
             <p class="article-content">In 1866, Latter-day Saint pioneers arrived in the northern end of the Cache Valley,
                stretching across southeastern Idaho and northeastern Utah. They founded a community in that location
                and named it Worm Creek, but in 1881 changed it to Preston because leaders of the LDS Church in Salt
                Lake City objected to the name "Worm Creek" being part of any church congregation's name. The name
                Preston was suggested by a local member to honor William B. Preston, who at the time was president of
                the LDS Church's Cache Stake.
            </p>
            
            <p class="article-content"> It was not until the 1880s while William C. Parkinson was serving as the bishop of the Preston LDS Ward
                that a regular townsite was laid out.For several years the city held a "Napoleon Dynamite Festival" in
                the summer. Many of the featured festival themes related to events occurring during the film. For
                example: Tetherball Tournament, Tater Tot Eating Contest, Moon Boot Dance, Impersonation, Look-A-Like
                Contest, Football Throwing Contest and more. In 2004 there was a single day event that drew
                approximately 300 people. Although this was not a large crowd, it did help raise $1,500 for the Preston
                School District Education Foundation. In 2005 an estimated 6,000 people attended the event and although
                the event was considered a success the town has decided not to continue it.
            </p>

            <p class="article-content">The 2007 and 2008 event was held along with the 'That Famous Preston Night Rodeo' in Preston. 'That
                Famous Preston Night Rodeo' is usually held in late July, along with the Franklin County parade. The
                rodeo's name ('That Famous Preston Night Rodeo') comes from it being the first rodeo held during night
                time. It includes many events such as bull riding, barrel racing, and other popular events. The Franklin
                county parade includes floats and advertisements of local businesses. The rodeo and parade remain one of
                the town's most popular local events and traditions.
